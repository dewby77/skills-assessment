## Development Experience
- ASP.NET C# (MVC) w/Entity framework
  - Very easy (and quick) to build a properly architected and secure web application
- ASP.NET Web API (Core)
  - This is new for me in the last month - easy to secure using JWT tokens.  I like how easy it is to use API's as the gatekeepers to the data or to use them as a wrapper to some other 3rd party API
- PHP
  - The wild, wild, west can happen with PHP - I can do a lot of things with images and PDFs so that is neat
- Java
  - I used it so long ago - at the time it was cool to use JSF with XSLT.  I was even able to get it to communicate with COBOL which is the only thing I liked about it, haha!
- COBOL
  - I like nothing about COBOL, although it may allow me to make a lot of money as a later in life COBOL contractor :)
- Web technologies/frameworks
  - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap - I love front-end work, we can make the screen do anything using these technologies.  It's typically the output a user wants to see, so it's rewarding to dream something up and create it for user consumption   
## Git Commands
- git branch
  - Show's me my local branches and which branch I'm on, hopefully it's not master :)
- git status
  - Keeps me in line for what I'm doing and which commands I need to run next, it also tells me which branch I'm on
- git checkout --track -b <local branch> <remote>/<tracked branch>
  - Creates a local branch from a remote branch and set's up the tracking at the same time so git push works
